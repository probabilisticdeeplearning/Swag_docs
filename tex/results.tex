\section{Results}

The toy model seems to indicate that the samples tend to be widely spread along directions where variance is large.
Does this make sense in terms of the gradients?
Consider a 1D normal distribution with quite small variance for the sample $x| \theta$.
If we sample $x$ far from the current mean estimate $\theta$, then due the small variance would result in large gradients, causing the result seen in fig \ref{fig:1d_low_var}. There should however be a mitigating effect due to the fact that we are unlikely to sample these far-away $x$'s and so giving smaller gradients. Experimentally this mitigation seems non-existent or inefficient, or it is something wrong with my implementation.
